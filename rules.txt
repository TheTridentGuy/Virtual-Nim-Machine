Rules:

The basics of nim are as follows:
A player takes a certain amount of gems from a pile. Their opponent also takes
gems from a pile. This repeats. The player to take the last gem either wins or loses

Note:
In the bottom-left corner of the window for a game there will be a chunk of text
showing the variation of nim being played. If applicable it will also show the
maximum amount of gems you can take.

Variations:

1 Pile Last Gem Wins:
In this variation there is only one pile of gems, and you can only take up to a certain
amount (this amount will be displayed in the bottom-left corner). The person who takes the
last gem wins.

1 Pile Last Gem Loses:
The same as 1 pile last gem wins except the person who takes the last gem loses.

2 Pile Last Gem Wins:
In this variation there are two piles of gems (the amount in each pile can be the same or different),
and you can take as many gems as you want but only from one pile. The person who takes
the last gem wins.

2 Pile Last Gem Loses:
The same as 2 pile last gem wins except the person who takes the last gem loses.

Good Luck!

Note:
In this game listing "person" could also mean "computer"!
